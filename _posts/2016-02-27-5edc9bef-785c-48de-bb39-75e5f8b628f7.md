Transitions at The Post Office

For one night only, a group of dynamic, daring and aware artists filled the main post office building with their expressions and reflections of our wonderful city - the landscape, its people and its energy.  
The artists reflected on the dynamic and resilient nature of Johannesburg - the landscape, the people and its soul. The exhibition was curated by Richard John Forbes and Danny Myburgh.

He states "When I first looked around the site I saw broken promises and missed opportunities, but the more I looked the more I noticed its soul. I knew that I needed to capture this haunting reflection of times gone by and times to come."
